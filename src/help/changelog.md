#### March 20, 2020{section=changelog}
In this release of the Broker, we:

* Updated the Broker front end to allow agencies to submit files for reporting periods that already have a certified submission. Previously the Broker prevented this and forced users to go into their certified submission to load files for the selected period. This change will allow much greater flexibility for testing data as well as testing system integration for agencies with these testing needs. The new submission will show a banner to indicate the selected reporting period has already been certified and this will be a test submission. The banner will also provide a link to the certified submission in the event the user wants to make changes to the official submission. A test submission cannot be certified so risk of test data being certified has been eliminated. Once testing is complete the submission can simply be deleted. This functionality is available via the front end or API.
* Updated the instructions for installing a copy of the Broker locally which will allow agencies to test how their custom systems to automate reporting will integrate with the Broker.  
* Updated links to sample submission files.
* Fixed a minor bug with page redirects.
