#### November 4, 2019{section=changelog}
In this release of the Broker, we:

* Fixed DABS front end bug where refreshing the page while in the submission workflow caused users to be taken to the furthest step the submission had reached rather than remaining on current page.
* Completed front end work on FABS permissions to allow a non-publishing role.
