##### November 1, 2018
In this release of the Broker, we:

* Updated Broker upload step to check the file type and only allow .CSV or .TXT (other file extensions will be rejected prior to uploading).
* The Broker now allows agencies to (optionally) generate File D1 and D2 by funding agency on both the detached File D page and within a submission.
* Added the last two filters to the Submission Dashboard pages. They allow filtering by the user that created the submission and the Last Modified Date of the submission.
* Reduced Broker user session timeout to a more reasonable timespan (30 minutes of inactivity).
* Various Broker Inbound API documentation improvements based on user feedback.
* Various minor bug fixes and improvements.
