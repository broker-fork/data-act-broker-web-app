##### November 30, 2018
In this release of the Broker, we:

* Updated the Broker to generate a provisional File A for agencies that they may use as a submission starting point (though only certifying to it if they verify its accuracy and completeness) or for reconciliation purposes. File A generation is accessed from the DABS homepage and happens outside the submission context.
* Various API documentation and error message improvements.
* Various memory management fixes that were causing publishing submissions to hang in isolated cases.
