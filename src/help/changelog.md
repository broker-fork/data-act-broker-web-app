In this release of the Broker, we:

* Updated the Broker so that DABS data cannot be certified prior to the opening of the DABS submission window. Such data can still be tested as normal. 
* Updated the Broker so data that was validated or generated prior to the opening of the certification window for a given quarter must be revalidated once the submission window for that quarter opens. This ensures that DABS validations are run against the full set of GTAS data) and that D files are not outdated for purposes of publication and cross-file validation.
* Minor UI improvement (display tweak to help page)
