#### April 19, 2019{section=changelog}
In this release of the Broker, we:

* In DABS, after clicking "Certify" and confirming, the “Certify” button is disabled and the text updated to indicate that certification is in progress.  This is to prevent users from accidentally clicking and certifying multiple times.
* Minor fix to the dropdown text on the File A Generation page, where the quarter indicators were previously misaligned in some cases; quarters now align to the appropriate period. 
* Updated the D1/D2 funding toggle within DABS to allow for separate toggle selections for D1/D2. This will provide agencies with the ability to choose 'funding' for one D file and 'awarding' for the other within DABS.
