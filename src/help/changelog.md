#### April 6, 2020{section=changelog}
In this release of the Broker, we:

* Updated Broker functionality to allow agencies to make changes to a previously certified submission, whether for testing purposes or with the intent to recertify, and then be able to abandon those changes and return their submission to its last certified status.  This includes returning all certified files as of the last certification as well as warning files and agency certification comments. To use this functionality, users will see a new button on the last step of the submission workflow (Step 5, Review and Publish) called Revert Submission to the left of the file comments box. Simply click the button and the submission will be reverted. The last modified date on the submission table will show the current date.
* Fixed other minor bugs.
